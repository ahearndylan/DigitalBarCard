Digital Bar Card Project Overview 
Project Idea:
The Digital Bar Card project aims to replace traditional paper-based Bar Cards for Massachusetts lawyers with digital versions. These cards can be stored on mobile devices, like Apple Wallet, and used for verification in court. The project integrates with the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers (BBO) database for lawyer verification.

Key Features:
User Registration & Authentication:

General users can create accounts.
Lawyers can verify their credentials via the BBO database.

Digital Bar Card Generation:
Verified lawyers can generate and store a digital Bar Card.
Cards include a scannable code for real-time verification.
Security & Logout:

Logout functionality redirects users to the login screen.
